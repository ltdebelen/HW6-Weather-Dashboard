# HW6-Weather-Dashboard

## Description
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

The app should be able to do the following: 

* Present current and future weather condition of city that has been entered from the search button. It will also include the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions and temperature.


* The city should be added from the recent searches. City that has been added from the search history can be clicked and should also display the weather information of the city.


* UV index should display a color coded background based on conditions. Green for favorable, orange for moderate, red for severe.

* Shows a 5-day forecast that displays the date, and an icon representation of weather conditions. 

* Recent searches are saved in localStorage. After page reload, the recently searched cities should persist.


## Other Criteria/Features
